            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have spent my entire adult life in the IT industry.  
            Many years spent in the sales and service of technology to small to medium businesses and end users. 
            My degree is in Computer Information Systems(CIS) with the emphasis on coding and business accounting. 
            I spent several years using my knowledge in a successful family-owned environmental consulting business. 
            Looking into the WEB3 environment about a year ago and seeing that this disruptive technology is going to be transformative. 
            This along with AI will transform the entire web ecosystem in the coming years. 
            This is just barely the surface of what WEB3 will be doing in the future.
